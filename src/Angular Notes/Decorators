## Decorators in Angular
============================
    - An Angular Decorators are used to Provide metadata to a class declaration, method, accessor, property.
    - We use in many places in our angular application 
    - we use it to decorate components, directives, modules, etc
    - decorators starts with '@' Symbol.


    def:
        - Typescript feature used to passing metadata.
        - decorators are functions that will return functions.
        - decorators are invoked at runtime.
        - decorators allows us to invoke functions.

        - We apply the decorator using  the form @expression, where expression is the name of the decorator.
        - Example:
        ===========
                @Component is an Angular decorator , which we can attach to an angular Component.
                - When Angular sees the @Component  decorator applied to a class, it treats the class as a component class.

                - If you do not apply decorator to class, that means without decorator it looks like normal class just like any other class.

                    @Component({
                        ....
                    })

                    export class AppComponent {
                        title = 'app';
                    }

## Why we need Angular decorator ?
======================================

    - Angular uses the decorators to provide metadata to the class, method, or property.
    - For example, the AppComponent must know where to find its template.
    - We do that by using the templateUrl parameter of the @Component directive.
    - The @Component decorator also accepts  the values  for styleUrls, encapsulation, changeDetection, etc, which  angular  uses to configure the component.

    - Example:
    =========
            @Component({
                            selector: 'app-hello-world',
                            standalone: true,
                            imports:[...],
                            templateUrl: './hello-world.component.html',
                            styleUrl: ['./hello-world.component.css']
                        })

            export class AppComponent{ 
                ...
            }


## Types of decorators in Angular ?
=================================================
        - Angular provides several built-in decorators. We classify them under four different categories.
        - There are Four types of decorators in an angular:
                1. Class Decorators
                2. Property decorators
                3. Method decorators
                4. Parameter decorators
        - All decorators in angular are represented with @ symbol.
        - The following is the complete list of Decorators in angular.

            1.Class Decorators
            ==================

                1. @NgModule
                2. @Component
                3. @Injectable
                4. @Directive
                5. @Pipe

            2. Property Decorators
                1. @Input
                2. @Output
                3. @HostBinding
                4. @ContentChild
                5. @ViewChild
                6. @ContentChildren
                7. @ViewChildren

            3. Method Decorators
                1. @HostListner
                
            4. Perameter decorators
                1. @Inject
                2. @Self
                3. @SkipSelf
                4. @Optional
                5. @Host
