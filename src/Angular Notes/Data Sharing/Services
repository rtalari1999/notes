## Services in Angular :
================================================
    - Service is a piece of reusable code with focused purpose.
    - A code that you will use in many components across your application.
    - Our components need to access the data.
    - You can write data access code in each component, but it is very inefficient and breaks the rule of single responsibility.
    - The component must focus on presenting data to the user.
    - The task of getting data from the back-end server must be delegated to some other class. we call such a class a service class.
    - because it provides the service of providing data to everycomponent that needs it.


## What Angular Services are used for
==============================================
    - Services are independent of components
    - share data across components
    - we can make external API calls i.e connecting to back-end API's and getting response and serving across the components as required.

## Advantages of Services in angular :
==============================================
    1. Services are easy to maintain and test.
    2. They are easy to debug.
    3. we can reuse the services at many places.

## How to create a service in angular :
===============================================
    - An angular Service is a simply javascript function.
    - and all we need to do is to create a class and add methods & properties.
    - then we can create  an instance of this class in our component and call its methods.
    - One of the best uses of services is to get the data from the data source.
    - let us create a simple service, which gets data and passes it to our component.



    - Now, Create instance in component. let's see how we will

        - create instance of service in constructor of component. =======>>>>>> this is one way
        - In real-life Angular apps, we use the dependency injection in angular.
            - i.e inject the services in constructor to use.
            - first, import service inside component
            - second, import inside providers in @component decorator.
            - third, inject into constructor of a class
                    constructor(private service : ServiceName){}

            - with reference you can access all methods of service class.
