## Angular Directives ?
=========================
    - Angular directives  are the most important feature of angular.
    - Angular directive helps us to manipulate the DOM.
    - You can change the appearance, behavior, or layout of DOM element using Directives.
    - They help you to extend HTML

    - There are three types of directives in Angular:
        1. Component Directive
        2. Structural Directives
        3. Attribute Directives



        1. Component Directives
        =========================
            - Components are special Directives in angular.
            - they are the directive with a template(view).
            - refered to components class.

        2. Structural Directives
        ========================
            - structural directives can change the DOM layout by adding or removing DOM elements.
            
            - In Old Versions of angular
                    - All Structural directives are preceded by Astrix Symbol (*).
                    - ## Commonly used Structural Directives
                        1. ngFor
                        2. ngIf
                        3. ngSwitch

            - In Latest Versions of Angular
                    - Structural Directives are Preceded by '@' Symbol.
            
                    - ## Commonly used Structural Directives
                         1. for

                         4. elseIf
                         5. switch

        3. Attribute Directives
        =======================
                    - An Attribute or style directive can  change the appearance or behavior of an element.
