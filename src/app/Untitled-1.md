## Wht are lifeCycle hooks in Angular ?
===================================================

    - Lifecycle hooks are a set of methods in Angular that are executed at specific moments during the lifecycle of a component.
        - There are eight lifecycle hooks in Angular:
            1. ngOnChanges          =======>>>>>>>>>> Commonly used method
            2. ngOnInit             =======>>>>>>>>>> Commonly used method
            3. ngDoCheck
            4. ngAfterContentInit
            5. ngAfterContentChecked
            6. ngAfterViewInit
            7. ngAfterViewChecked
            8. ngOnDestroy          =======>>>>>>>>>> Commonly used method


function fun(){
    Hello Welcome
}

ngOnChanges always listens to Input decorator property which can get data from parent to child component.


b ='hello world'

a = [1,2,3,4]

a = [1,2,3,4,5],[]



ngDoCheck 


<button>
